			<description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working as a software engineer for a while now. I&amp;rsquo;m a mom. This is my blog. How did I get here? Back up to around the time Linux became a thing. I was at Northeastern University, a double major in Chemical Engineering and Biology. This is my blog so I can brag. I was at NU on a full academic scholarship. I made some good friends, earned good grades, was inducted into Tau Beta Pi, the National Honor Society of Engineers (that&amp;rsquo;s so when I tell you the next part, you don&amp;rsquo;t assume I flunked out of engineering).</description>

			<title>PR Checkout No Remote</title>

			<description>You don&amp;rsquo;t have to add a remote to checkout a Pull Request or a friend&amp;rsquo;s branch! If you already know this, then move along. Whenever I mention to somebody about how I check out a branch to review a PR, 99% of the time, they thank me and say, I&#39;ve always just added a new remote! This is way faster, thanks! I figured, then, that this would be a good little blog post, if I ever got around to creating my blog.</description>
