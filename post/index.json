                "body": "I\u0026rsquo;ve been working as a software engineer for a while now. I\u0026rsquo;m a mom. This is my blog. How did I get here? Back up to around the time Linux became a thing. I was at Northeastern University, a double major in Chemical Engineering and Biology. This is my blog so I can brag. I was at NU on a full academic scholarship. I made some good friends, earned good grades, was inducted into Tau Beta Pi, the National Honor Society of Engineers (that\u0026rsquo;s so when I tell you the next part, you don\u0026rsquo;t assume I flunked out of engineering).\nI did not want to be a Chemical Engineer. I threw away the final year of my scholarship to graduate a year early with a generic biology degree with which I could do very little. I had taken a few painting courses along the way and I was going to be an artist, live out of a backpack, whatever that means. I met my husband. I studied Sanskrit. I learned to play the flute. I moved to Napa, CA. I traveled.\nMy father was diagnosed with cancer, with 3-6 months to live. He passed away 5 months later. I spent those months with him in Maine. I was forced to question my place in the universe, and what it was I was meant to do here. I felt the need to stop puttering around and figure that out.\nFast forward five years. I was now the mother of a beautiful daughter and baby boy. I loved and still love being a mom and a wife. I was plagued with the notion that there was something else I was meant to do, that my education was incomplete. This feeling was constant and tiring.\nThere is one class at Northeastern I loved the most. It was a fluid mechanics course, during which I wrote my first computer program. I taught myself just enough C to complete an assignment. I remember sitting in a computer lab for hours, tracking down rogue parentheses and semicolons. I remember the feeling of victory when I entered some tank measurments, pipe diameters, and viscosities, and my program output the time it would take to empty the tank. That memory is the reason I enrolled at UMass, to study as many programming courses as I could, and ended up with a degree in Information Technology and an internship at Red Hat.\nMy first two weeks at Red Hat I learned git. My first pull request merged, it was a README addition. I noticed there weren\u0026rsquo;t many women engineers. I mean, there really were not many women engineers. That\u0026rsquo;s all I can say about that. I\u0026rsquo;m not here to solve that problem, not yet. I\u0026rsquo;m learning some things new every single day. I\u0026rsquo;ll keep learning, to be a mentor for anyone who comes in behind me.\nSpeaking of mentors, I\u0026rsquo;ve had many. I graduated from intern to associate software engineer to software engineer. I\u0026rsquo;m lucky to work with some brilliant people whose ideas are shaping the future. I want to share some of the cool things I\u0026rsquo;ve learned from working with lots of really smart people. Lately it\u0026rsquo;s Kubernetes and OpenShift but I try to mix it up a bit. I\u0026rsquo;m living my dream.\n"

                "body": "You don\u0026rsquo;t have to add a remote to checkout a Pull Request or a friend\u0026rsquo;s branch! If you already know this, then move along. Whenever I mention to somebody about how I check out a branch to review a PR, 99% of the time, they thank me and say, I've always just added a new remote! This is way faster, thanks! I figured, then, that this would be a good little blog post, if I ever got around to creating my blog.\nSay you are tasked with reviewing a colleague\u0026rsquo;s pull request, or your friend has a much needed feature in their branch that you want to take advantage of before there\u0026rsquo;s a pull request. What do you do? If you don\u0026rsquo;t do this, you\u0026rsquo;re probably doing it the hard way:\nNote: The repositories mentioned here do not exist.\nAssume you have your fork of cool-repo checked out locally, and you need to work with your friend\u0026rsquo;s branch of cool-repo.\nThen, here\u0026rsquo;s the little bit of convenience:\n$ cd cool-repo $ git fetch git@github.com:your-friend/cool-repo.git much-needed-branch $ git checkout FETCH_HEAD Now, you\u0026rsquo;ll be in detached mode, and if you\u0026rsquo;re simply reviewing a PR, go ahead and work from there. However, if you\u0026rsquo;ll be messing around and making changes in this branch, you can create a full-fledged branch by:\n$ git checkout -b now-it-is-my-much-needed-branch\nThat\u0026rsquo;s it! Hope I save you a few seconds of adding/deleting remotes.\n"
