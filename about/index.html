    <p>I&rsquo;ve been working as a software engineer for a while now. I&rsquo;m a mom. This is my blog.</p>
<p>How did I get here?</p>
<p>Back up to around the time Linux became a thing. I was at Northeastern University, double-majoring in Chemical Engineering and Biology. This is my
blog, so I get to brag: I was at NU on a full academic scholarship. I made good friends, earned good grades, was inducted into Tau Beta Pi, the
National Engineering Honor Society (that’s so you don’t assume I flunked out when I tell you what came next).</p>
<p>I did not want to be a chemical engineer. I threw away the final year of my scholarship and graduated early with a generic biology degree I could
do very little with. I had taken a few painting courses and decided I was going to be an artist — live out of a backpack, whatever that meant. I
met my husband. I studied Sanskrit. I learned to play the flute. I moved to Napa, CA. I traveled.</p>
<p>Then my father was diagnosed with cancer and given three to six months to live. He passed away five months later. I spent that time with him. Loss
forced me to question my place in the universe, and what it was I was meant to do here. I felt the need to stop drifting and figure that out.
Fast-forward five years. I was now the mother of a beautiful daughter and baby boy. Our family was complete, but I was still carrying the sense
that there was something else I was meant to do — that my education was unfinished. That feeling was constant and tiring.</p>
<p>There was one class at Northeastern I loved more than any other: a fluid mechanics course where I wrote my first computer program. I taught myself
just enough C to complete an assignment. I can still remember sitting in that computer lab for hours, wrestling with parentheses and semicolons,
and the feeling of victory when my program spat out the time it would take to empty a tank. That tiny moment is what pushed me to enroll at UMass
Lowell to take as many programming courses as I could. I graduated with a degree in Information Technology and, somehow, landed an internship at
Red Hat.</p>
<p>My first two weeks, I learned git. My first pull request was a README addition — and I still remember the thrill of seeing it merge. I
joined a project everyone was excited about at the time: Docker. I could tell it was important because our priorities shifted toward it.
I joined the team porting our application platform, OpenShift, into Go so we could adopt this other exciting new project, Kubernetes. Through
what still feels like some unexplainable synchronicity, I learned alongside original Linux and Kubernetes contributors. The rest is history.</p>
<p>I wanted to share cool things I was learning from working with so many brilliant people. I really thought I’d write regularly here.
But as you can tell by the date on this post — I didn’t. Life kept moving. Work kept evolving. And the dream kept growing. Rather than
rewrite my origin story, I’m keeping it as a marker of how the world looked to me then.</p>
<p><strong>Five years later…</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m now a Principal Software Engineer. I went from intern to associate to engineer to senior to principal. The trajectory that once felt impossible — back when I was working part-time at Trader Joe&rsquo;s trying to understand Linux, pointers, and linked lists — ended up becoming my life.
I now co-teach a course at Boston University called <em>Software Engineering Career Prep</em>, where I help aspiring software developers learn the
tools and insights I wish I knew on my first day as an intern. The industry has transformed dramatically — especially in the last few months.
AI has fundamentally changed what it means to be a software engineer, in ways I&rsquo;m still processing and will be writing about here. But some things
haven&rsquo;t changed: I&rsquo;m still learning something new every day. I&rsquo;m still surrounded by brilliant people shaping the future.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m still living my dream — just a bigger, stranger, more interesting version of it than I could have imagined in 2020.</p>
