          <p>I recently made a statement to my team and broader organization that had mixed
reactions. I said: &ldquo;AI is a thousand times better than me at writing code.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a pause. A few raised eyebrows. Some polite skepticism. A sense that
I had either exaggerated wildly or accidentally declared myself obsolete.
So I want to explain what I meant, because I stand by it. And also because it
absolutely does not mean I have been replaced or that I&rsquo;m relaxing on a
beach somewhere, sipping a mint julep.</p>

          <p>When you give two software engineers the same problem, you can often predict what they&rsquo;ll do next, regardless of seniority or skill level.
Developers usually follow one of two instincts. One instinct is motion. Make something happen as quickly as possible. Open an editor,
wire things together, push until the system does <em>anything</em> at all. It doesn’t have to be elegant or correct, it just has to exist. For these
developers, forward motion creates clarity. Code is how they ask questions.</p>

<p>Over the last few months, my role as a software developer has profoundly transformed.
I didn&rsquo;t negotiate a new title or adopt a new framework. Without ceremony or fanfare, the job itself simply changed.
With AI&rsquo;s quiet and reliable power, old workflows have become obsolete.
Not using AI stopped making sense. The ground moved beneath me.</p>
<p>I didn’t decide to work differently. AI became too good to ignore.
I used to write everything from scratch: a Kubernetes controller, a bash script,
a system manifest. That was the job. Today, I describe that same controller’s desired
behavior to an AI, and it generates the entire, clean codebase, complete with
scaffolding, RBAC, and tests. It’s not just generating code; it’s providing instant
access to a compressed universe of accumulated patterns and knowledge.
What&rsquo;s more, when the model understands the workflow, and I can give it a runner or tool access,
executing code can often become redundant. We can now bypass code entirely by delegating behavior
in plain text to an AI runner.</p>
