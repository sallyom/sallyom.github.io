    <p>I&rsquo;ve been working as a software engineer for a while now.  I&rsquo;m a mom.  This is
my blog.  How did I get here?  Back up to around the time Linux became a thing.
I was at Northeastern University, a double major in Chemical Engineering
and Biology.  This is my blog so I can brag.  I was at NU on a full academic
scholarship.  I made some good friends, earned good grades, was inducted into
Tau Beta Pi, the National Honor Society of Engineers (that&rsquo;s so when I
tell you the next part, you don&rsquo;t assume I flunked out of engineering).</p>
<p>I did not want to be a Chemical Engineer. I threw away the final year
of my scholarship to graduate a year early with a generic biology degree with
which I could do very little.  I had taken a few painting courses along the
way and I was going to be an artist, live out of a backpack, whatever that
means. I met my husband.  I studied Sanskrit. I learned to play the flute.
I moved to Napa, CA.  I traveled.</p>
<p>My father was diagnosed with cancer, with 3-6 months to live.
He passed away 5 months later.  I spent those months with him in Maine.
I was forced to question my place in the universe, and what it was I was
meant to do here.  I felt the need to stop puttering around and figure
that out.</p>
<p>Fast forward five years.  I was now the mother of a beautiful daughter and
baby boy.  I loved and still love being a mom and a wife.  I was plagued
with the notion that there was something else I was meant to do, that my
education was incomplete.  This feeling was constant and tiring.</p>
<p>There is one class at Northeastern I loved the most. It was a fluid mechanics
course, during which I wrote my first computer program.  I taught myself just
enough C to complete an assignment.  I remember sitting in a computer lab
for hours, tracking down rogue parentheses and semicolons. I remember the
feeling of victory when I entered some tank measurements, pipe diameters, and
viscosities, and my program output the time it would take to empty the tank.
That memory is the reason I enrolled at UMass, to study as many programming
courses as I could afford, and ended up with a degree in Information Technology and
an internship at Red Hat.</p>
<p>My first two weeks at Red Hat I learned git.  My first pull request merged,
it was a README addition.  I noticed there weren&rsquo;t many women engineers.  I mean,
there <em>really</em> were not many women engineers. That&rsquo;s all I can say about that.
I&rsquo;m not here to solve that problem, not yet.
I&rsquo;m learning some things new every single day.  I&rsquo;ll keep learning,
to be a mentor for anyone who comes in behind me.</p>
<p>Speaking of mentors, I&rsquo;ve had many.  I graduated from intern to associate software
engineer to software engineer.  I&rsquo;m lucky to work with some brilliant people whose
ideas are shaping the future.  I want to share some of the cool things I&rsquo;ve learned
from working with lots of really smart people.  Lately it&rsquo;s been Kubernetes and
OpenShift but I try to mix it up a bit.  I&rsquo;m living my dream.</p>
